							<div class="content color4 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">The Tidal Effect: Unraveling the Influence on Wave Heights</h2>
								<p>The perpetual dance of the Earth, Moon, and Sun not only marks the passage of time but also sculpts the ocean's surface. Tides — the long-period waves that roll around the planet — are the result of the celestial tug-of-war, and they hold sway over the marine realm. By examining the tides, we glimpse the subtle yet powerful forces that shape our shorelines and influence the creation of waves that surfers seek.</p>
								<p>Each tide phase, from the gentle swells at high tide to the exposed seafloors at low tide, presents a different facet of the ocean's character. At high tide, waves reach further up the shore, potentially increasing wave heights and affecting wave shape and energy. Conversely, during low tide, waves break in shallower water, which can cause them to be steeper and break more quickly. The interplay between these tidal phases and the surf is a complex ballet, dictated by the gravitational pulls of our lunar and solar neighbors.</p>
								<p>By analyzing how different tide levels correlate with wave heights, we uncover patterns that are both predictable in their rhythm and variable in their expression. This analysis is not just for the academically curious; it has practical implications for coastal planning, marine navigation, and the leisurely pursuits of beachgoers and surfers alike. Recognizing the tide's influence allows for better prediction of wave conditions, contributing to safety and enjoyment along our coasts.</p>

						<!-- Panel (Swell Direction Preface) -->
						<section class="panel banner large left">
							<div class="content color2 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">Understanding Swell Direction and Wave Height</h2>
								<p>Swell direction is the direction from which ocean waves are approaching. It is an essential factor in surf forecasting as it influences both the size and quality of the waves at a particular beach. Swells are created by winds blowing across the surface of the ocean, often from storms hundreds or thousands of miles away. When these swells reach the coastline, they transform into the breaking waves that surfers ride.</p>
								<p>The visualization on the left shows the average swell direction in degrees around Morro Bay, with the circular heatmap representing the average wave heights corresponding to each direction. The color intensity indicates the wave height, with warmer colors representing higher waves.</p>
								<p>Notably, Morro Rock, a prominent landmark, can be seen in the map on the right. It acts as a natural breakwater, influencing the local wave patterns. Our data indicates that swells originating from the south tend to produce larger waves in Morro Bay. This phenomenon can be attributed to the specific bathymetry of the seabed and the shape of the coastline which can amplify southern swells.</p>
								<p>Understanding the relationship between swell direction and wave height is crucial for coastal activities such as surfing, boating, and shoreline construction. By analyzing the patterns displayed in the heatmap, enthusiasts and professionals can make informed decisions for a variety of purposes.</p>

						<!-- Panel (Peak Period Preface) -->
						<section class="panel banner large left">
							<div class="content color1 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">What is a Wave Period?</h2>
								<p>The <strong>wave period</strong> is the time it takes for two successive wave crests (or troughs) to pass a fixed point. It is an essential metric for understanding the energy and movement of waves. Longer wave periods indicate waves that have traveled across vast distances, often leading to well-formed, powerful waves that are favored by surfers.</p>
								<p>In the accompanying illustration, you can see that the distance between successive wave crests is greater for waves with a longer period. These waves typically originate from storms far out at sea and can travel large distances to reach the shore, bringing with them more energy, which translates into higher wave heights.</p>
								<p>Conversely, waves with shorter periods are typically more locally generated and have less energy. These waves are closer together, and while they may occur more frequently, they are generally smaller in size and less powerful than their long-period counterparts.</p>
								<p>By studying peak period data alongside wave heights, we can gain insights into the potential impact of waves on coastal areas, which is crucial for activities such as surfing, boating, and coastal management.</p>

						<!-- Panel (Wave Partitions Explanation) -->
						<section class="panel banner large left" id="wave_partitions_explanation">
							<div class="content color4 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">Understanding Wave Partitions</h2>
								<p>Wave partitions represent the division of the total significant wave height into components that correspond to different wave systems or swells present in the ocean at any given time. Each partition captures a unique set of characteristics—such as direction, period, and height—associated with a portion of the overall wave structure.</p>
								<p>In our data, we observe six partitions labeled <code>lotusSighPartX_mt</code>, where <code>X</code> ranges from 0 to 5. Each partition measures the significant wave height for a particular wave system, with the sum of these partitions providing an approximation of the total significant wave height, denoted as <code>lotusSigh_mt</code>.</p>
								<p>The total significant wave height <code>lotusSigh_mt</code> is a commonly used oceanographic metric that represents the average height of the highest one-third of waves in the middle of the ocean. It is a key indicator of the overall energy present in the wave field and is not to be confused with breaking wave height, which is observed near the shore.</p>
								<p>By analyzing wave partitions, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the wave field's complexity and how different wave systems interact. This insight is invaluable for applications such as maritime navigation, offshore operations, and surf forecasting.</p>

						<section class="panel banner large left">
							<div class="content color2 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">Weighted Sum of Wave Partitions vs. Total Significant Wave Height</h2>
								<p>The chart visualizes the relationship between the weighted sum of wave partitions and the total significant wave height, denoted as <code>lotusSigh_mt</code>. Each partition represents a segment of the wave system and has been weighted differently to approximate the total significant wave height. The weights used are [1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2] for the partitions respectively, acknowledging that not all partitions contribute equally to the observed wave height.</p>
								<p>It's important to note that while there is a strong correlation, the sum of partitions does not perfectly equal the total significant wave height. This discrepancy may be due to various factors, such as the interaction between different wave systems, or the methodology used to measure and record these metrics.</p>
								<p>The variable <code>lotusSigh_mt</code> represents the significant wave height in the middle of the ocean, which differs from breaking wave heights observed near the coast. Significant wave height is a statistical measure that denotes the mean height of the highest third of waves in a wave spectrum, averaged over a period of time. This measure is critical for understanding the general sea conditions far from shore, and is particularly useful for navigation, marine forecasting, and offshore operations.</p>
