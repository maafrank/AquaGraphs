								<h2 class="major">Unveiling Seasonal Patterns in Breaking Wave Heights</h2>
								<p>Wave heights change with the seasons, influencing not only marine life but also the activities of surfers and coastal communities. This section looks at how these changes occur throughout the year and what they might mean for us.</p>
								<p>For anyone interested in the best times to surf, or for those who live by the coast, understanding these patterns can help us plan better. It's also important for scientists who are studying the sea and its creatures.</p>
								<p>We will take a closer look at the seasonal changes in wave heights. What we find may give us new insights into how the ocean behaves throughout the year.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Tidal Effect: Unraveling the Influence on Wave Heights</h2>
								<p>The movements of the Earth, Moon, and Sun don't just tell time—they also shape the sea. Tides are like slow-moving waves around our planet, created by the gravitational pull between these celestial bodies. These tides affect the size and shape of waves that crash onto our shores, which is especially important to surfers.</p>
								<p>Tides can make waves change dramatically. When the tide is high, waves can grow larger and reach further up the beach. When it's low, they break closer to shore and can be more powerful. Understanding how tides and waves interact helps us predict where and when the best waves for surfing will be.</p>
								<p>Our analysis of tides and wave heights shows a pattern that can help us in many ways, from designing safer coastlines to planning the perfect time for surfing. Knowing how the tides affect waves helps us enjoy the ocean safely and fully.</p>

						<!-- Panel (Swell Direction Preface) -->
						<section class="panel banner large left">
							<div class="content color2 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">Understanding Swell Direction and Wave Height</h2>
								<p>Wave directions are important for understanding where good surfing waves will come from. The winds over the ocean, sometimes from distant storms, create these swells. Once they hit the shore, they turn into waves for surfing.</p>
								<p>Our chart shows which way the waves come from around Morro Bay. Different colors on the chart show different wave heights—the warmer the color, the bigger the wave.</p>
								<p>You can also see Morro Rock on the map, a big rock that changes the way waves move. It seems that waves from the south get bigger at Morro Bay because of the way the sea floor and coast are shaped there.</p>
								<p>Knowing where waves come from and how big they might be is really useful for things like surfing, sailing, and building on the coast. This chart helps people who love the sea make smart choices.</p>							</div>

						<!-- Panel (Peak Period Preface) -->
						<section class="panel banner large left">
							<div class="content color1 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">What is a Wave Period?</h2>
								<p>A <strong>wave period</strong> is how long it takes for one wave to follow another at a certain point. This helps us know how much energy a wave has. Bigger, well-shaped waves that surfers like have longer periods because they come from far away, often from big storms out at sea.</p>
								<p>The diagram shows that waves with longer periods have a wider gap between them and bring more energy, making the waves higher when they reach the beach.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, waves with shorter periods start closer to the shore, have less energy, and are smaller and weaker. They happen more often but aren't as good for surfing.</p>
								<p>Looking at the wave period together with the wave heights on the graph, we can understand better how waves will affect the coast. This is really important for surfing, boating, and planning things along the shoreline.</p>							</div>

						<!-- Panel (Wave Partitions Explanation) -->
						<section class="panel banner large left" id="wave_partitions_explanation">
							<div class="content color4 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">Understanding Wave Partitions</h2>
								<p>Waves in the ocean come from different systems, and 'wave partitions' help us break down and study these systems separately. Each partition shows us a part of the bigger picture, including where the waves are coming from, how often they come, and how big they are.</p>
								<p>We track six main wave types, each labeled from <code>lotusSighPart0_mt</code> to <code>lotusSighPart5_mt</code>. These labels help us measure and add up the heights of waves from each system to understand the total wave activity in the ocean.</p>
								<p>When we talk about the 'total significant wave height,' it's the average height of the biggest waves out in the open ocean, which tells us about the energy of the waves. This is different from the 'breaking wave height,' which is the waves we see breaking at the beach.</p>
								<p>Studying these different wave parts gives us a clearer idea of how complex the ocean's behavior is. This knowledge is very useful for things like guiding ships, managing offshore projects, and predicting the best times for surfing.</p>

						<section class="panel banner large left">
							<div class="content color2 span-10">
								<h2 class="major">Weighted Sum of Wave Partitions vs. Total Significant Wave Height</h2>
								<p>This chart shows how different wave types combine to give us the average height of the biggest waves in the open sea, a number we call <code>lotusSigh_mt</code>. We use different weights, like [1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2], for each wave type because some waves have a bigger impact than others.</p>
								<p>While these numbers usually match up, they're not always perfect. That's because the ocean's waves are complex, and how we measure them can vary.</p>
								<p>The term <code>lotusSigh_mt</code> is about the average size of the largest waves way out at sea, not the ones breaking at the beach. It's important for understanding overall sea conditions, helping ships to navigate safely, and predicting what the ocean will do.</p>
